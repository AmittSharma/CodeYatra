# Here are 5 functional project examples that are:

1. General-purpose and extensible
2. Practical for both monolith and microservices
3. Suitable for implementing core Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, DBs, REST APIs, etc.
4. Rich enough to include security, testing, CI/CD, cloud, containerization, AI/ML hooks, etc.

## âœ… 1. Smart Travel Planner
#### A system where users enter their preferences (budget, interests, duration), and the app recommends travel destinations, suggests itineraries, and books hotels/flights.

##### You can implement:

- Spring Boot services (user, recommendation, booking)
- DB integration (user history, bookings)
- Kafka (logging events, notifications)
- ML module (recommendation engine)
- API integrations (Google Maps, hotel APIs)
- Role-based login & security
- CI/CD pipeline for deployments

## âœ… 2. Personal Finance Tracker
#### A tool for individuals to track income, expenses, savings, and get investment suggestions.

#### You can implement:

- REST APIs for CRUD on expenses, categories
- Scheduled tasks (monthly reports)
- DB (transaction storage, reports)
- Kafka (event logging, fraud detection)
- Docker + Jenkins pipeline
- Integrate AI (expense prediction / smart budget suggestions)
- OAuth2 security

## âœ… 3. Online Learning Platform
#### A mini Udemy/Coursera-type platform where users can enroll in courses, view videos, take quizzes.

#### You can implement:

- Microservices: Auth, Course, Quiz, User
- JPA for entity management
- RabbitMQ/Kafka for notifications
- REST + GraphQL API mix
- OpenAPI + Swagger for documentation
- Redis for caching
- Elasticsearch for course search

## âœ… 4. Smart Health Monitoring System
#### Track vitals like BP, heart rate, and suggest alerts/doctor consults based on thresholds or history.

#### You can implement:

- Device-to-API integration (simulate IoT)
- Rule engine for health alerts
- Kafka for streaming vitals data
- AI model to detect anomaly
- Spring Security with JWT
- RESTful + WebSocket notifications

## âœ… 5. eCommerce Store

#### A basic Amazon-style system with cart, payment, search, and order management.

#### You can implement:

- Full domain modeling (Product, Cart, Order, Payment)
- DDD and event-driven architecture
- Search with Elasticsearch
- Spring Cloud for config, gateway
- Kafka for order updates
- External APIs for payment gateway 
- Frontend integration (React/Vue)
